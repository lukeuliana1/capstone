	p Web application enabling communication between the school's Castone project team and Capital One
	.description-container
		p Capital One has teams supporting 21 schools and recruits from well over 50 for engineers. In the past, we have worked with senior teams for Capstone projects at multiple schools (at least 3) but we are in discussions for how to scale that to more of the schools that we work with. Understandably, management for so many projects and schools can be incredibly time consuming, and communication is always a challenge. We have started to develop a web application that would better enable communication between the school’s Capstone project team and Capital One, where the team can show off everything they are working on throughout the semester. In addition to showing off the team’s work, the web app will be used to help the student teams manage their capstone projects and allow Capital One employees to manage all the different teams’ projects easier. We currently have a system that incorporates different interfaces for students, employees, and administration that works to manage the Capstone projects from different teams in different schools. We challenge you to improve and add on to this existing web application. We plan to include more functionality to the web app and incorporate additional features. Features may include, but are not limited to, leveraging APIs, a blog post/feed for students to ask questions and communicate, statistics for employees to monitor progress on the teams, as well as anything more that would make the app more meaningful and increase productivity. This web app has been created using Django/Python, and we plan to continue to use this framework. A site visit will be incorporated to discuss the project and offer some help with app development or design thinking as needed.
